Welcome to the **Arduino Blink Project** — your first nightmarish adventure into the world of microcontrollers! ⚡  

This project shows how to make an LED blink on an **Arduino Uno R3** board. 💡  
It’s the classic "Hello, World!" of electronics — except instead of words, it’s lights.  
*(Caution: may include late-night wire negotiations, LED tantrums, and accidental Python enlightenment 😆)*

## 🧠 What is Arduino?  

**Arduino** is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software.  
It allows anyone — from complete beginners to engineers — to create interactive projects.  

Arduino boards can read inputs (like light, temperature, or buttons) and turn them into outputs (like LEDs, motors, or displays).  

The main programming language is **C++**,  
but since I’m currently studying **Python**, I used a **Python interpreter** to communicate with the board.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup  

Here’s how to get started with this project:  

1. **Clone the repository**  
```git clone https://github.com/NadiaS80/arduino_and_math.git```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**  
```cd aarduino_and_math```  

3. **Install dependencies** (if using Python and Firmata)  
```pip install pyfirmata```  

4. **Connect your Arduino Uno R3** via USB.  

5. **Upload the Firmata firmware** to your Arduino using the Arduino IDE:  
   - Open the Arduino IDE  
   - Go to **File → Examples → Firmata → StandardFirmata**  
   - Click **Upload**  

This allows Python to communicate directly with your Arduino board.

## 💡 Running the Project  

To start the blinking magic, simply run:  

```python blink.py```  

If everything’s set up correctly — congrats! 🎉  
Your LED should start blinking, proving that the connection between code and hardware is alive and kicking.

## 🔧 Technologies Used  

- **Arduino Uno R3** — the heart of the project  
- **Python 3** — for scripting and communication  
- **PyFirmata** — a Python library that bridges Python and Arduino  
- **C++** — the native language of Arduino

## ✨ Behind the Project  

This project started as a hands-on experiment to explore how hardware and software interact.  
It’s a bridge between the world of **electronics** and **coding**,  
and a small step toward understanding how machines communicate — blink by blink.
